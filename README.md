# Text Based Dungeons And Dragons
<p>
  This project involes the use of character classes to create a text based environment in which the player can interact and play a simple, text based version of Dungeons and Dragons. Make sure to have all files installed and compiled before running "./a.out" in the Terminal in order to play.
